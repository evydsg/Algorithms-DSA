# Insert into a Binary Search Tree  
**Solved**

You are given the root node of a **binary search tree (BST)** and a value `val` to insert into the tree.  
Return the root node of the BST after the insertion.  

It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.  

> **Note:** There may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion.  
> You can return any of them.


## Example 1

**Input:**  
root = [5,3,9,1,4], val = 6

**Output:**  
[5,3,9,1,4,6]

## Example 2

**Input:**  
root = [5,3,6,null,4,null,10,null,null,7], val = 9

**Output:**  
[5,3,6,null,4,null,10,null,null,7,null,null,9]

## Constraints
- `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 10,000`  
- `-100,000,000 <= val, Node.val <= 100,000,000`  
- All the values `Node.val` are **unique**  
- Itâ€™s guaranteed that `val` does not exist in the original BST
